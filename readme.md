This is my Task Master app day 1. So far, I have created a home page with two buttons that take you to an Add Task page or a All Tasks page. This is a screenshot of the home page:

The Add Task page allows you to add a task with a title and a description. When the Add Task button is clicked, you create an instance of a task with that title and description. I have written unit tests for the task class.

The All Tasks page is just a simple Android activity with a small image per the instructions.
