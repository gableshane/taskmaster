Day 1

This is my Task Master app day 1. So far, I have created a home page with two buttons that take you to an Add Task page or a All Tasks page. This is a screenshot of the home page:

The Add Task page allows you to add a task with a title and a description. When the Add Task button is clicked, you create an instance of a task with that title and description. I have written unit tests for the task class.

The All Tasks page is just a simple Android activity with a small image per the instructions.

Day 2

The Taskmaster app now has a settings button on the home page where the user can enter and save their username and it will be saved in Shared Preferences.

There are also 3 hard coded task's on the home page now and when you click the title of that task will be displayed in the task detail activity as shown below.

Day ??

Days later, I have finally figured out how to get this working. The app now displays a recycler view and you can click through to the task detail page via the recycler view.
